        <p>Ethan Gander is a 25-year-old multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer from Northern California.</p>
        <p>Navigating with ease between genres and instruments (vocals, piano, guitar, bass and drums to name a few), his goal is to create music that resonates with his listeners. His signature sound wraps seemingly disparate ideas – the energy of the dance floor, 50s crooner vibes, post-breakup melancholy, and a sax solo – into coherent tracks that make listeners laugh, cry and move.</p>
        <p>As an instructor at Canova Records and the Ukiah School of Music since 2015, Ethan has helped countless youth and adults develop their own musical passions.</p>
        <p>No matter his role – solo artist, band leader and member, educator, composer or producer – Ethan is focused on using his vast skillset to make music come alive for others.</p>
